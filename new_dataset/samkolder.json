Max had plans already but he knew this was way more important so we rented a car and sent it to bosnia. Made it just in time for sunset and we both sent it off the 80ft (24m) bridge!

A quote I read recently from the book \u201cthe Psychology of Money\u201d that really stuck with me. A quote that doesn\u2019t only apply in the world of finance, but in all areas of life. We learn more through experience. I think that\u2019s why I like to throw myself into the fire in many areas of life. Put myself in a situation where I\u2019ve commited to something so there\u2019s no backing out. I have no option but to perform. And weather I succeed or not, I know that what I\u2019ll get out of it is experience.

But after a lot of revisions and learning, the course is finally at a place to go out to the world and have its first round of students. \n\nThis first installment of the course is focused on the foundations of Premeire Pro, After Effects, Shooting, Technicalities and FPV.  A lot of very important information that I wish I had when I was first developing my workflow as a creative. Honestly Even a year ago when I considered myself a \u201chighly skilled\u201d editor, i still would have been able to drastically speed up my workflow and improve my quality with the information i share in this course. I walk you guys through my editing process in both Premiere Pro and After Effects then dive into the world of FPV as well as shooting and business. \n\nThis is just the start for me. My vision with this course is to constantly be upgrading my content and updating these lessons with everything I've learned, and everything I am yet to learn throughout my journey as an editor / filmmaker. \n\nThank you for your continued support.

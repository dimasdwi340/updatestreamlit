We cannot look away while so many homes, lives and futures are reduced to ash. We must make the change we want to see for our world, and right now millions can\u2019t see through the smoke.\n\nOur country has been burning for months. 20 lives have been lost, with dozens of people missing. An estimated 500 million animals have perished. Over 12 million acres of land has burnt. These fires will continue to burn for weeks, months to come.

One of our biggest hopes for 2019 was to spend as much time at home as possible, but we\u2019ve somehow spent nearly 5 months of it living in hospital. This little getaway was so that I could finally work and shoot my collection with @spell, and a much needed change of scenery for us all. We had barely checked in to @saltatshoalbay before realising a beautiful family that we know from hospital were also staying there with the same idea! It was surreal being able to get to know each other in the outside world, spontaneously popping champagne to celebrate our daughters. There is nothing more special than enjoying something so normal, and watching them finally able to meet and play together for the first time (both immunodeficient) despite having spent weeks living just rooms apart. \ud83d\ude4c", "comment_count": 1108, "like_count": 81382}, "post2": {"caption": "And just for a moment it feels like magic... \u2728 Taking my dream @spell gown for a spin, and swim.

I travelled solo and I made friends of strangers. I wandered cities, alleyways, markets and maps. I fell in to a habit of collecting pieces; thrift, vintage or special pieces by local labels that became my souvenirs, my momentos. They travelled with me through the next country or continent, either making memories when worn or stuffed inside my single suitcase. A few years ago my favourite label @spell asked if I wanted to design a few special pieces together, inspired by those pieces I had collected travelling and my favourite\u2019s from their bohemian collections. To say this is a dream realised is an understatement. On Thursday @spell are releasing our collaboration, a limited edition collection of four pieces. I don\u2019t know if I will ever travel like that again but I\u2019m giddy and grateful that these pieces could accompany moments of someone else\u2019s journey.

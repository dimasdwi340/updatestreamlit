There really is no better lens that fits in a day pack and that lets you look at the clouds up close at the same time!\nOur goal was to spend the night at this decommissioned fire lookout tower but as we got there we realized the wind has completely destroyed it.. We ended up building a wall to shield us from the gnarly winds that relentlessly blew all night. I\u2019d do it again in a heartbeat.

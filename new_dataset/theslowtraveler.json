We both love pictures that capture special moments, feel like little scenes from bigger stories, have something secret-like about them. As a travel photographer, I want you to put yourself in my pictures and wonder what's happened and what's going to happen next. Our locket had to somehow represent these shared ideas on travel, memory and imagination.\n\u2800\nWe came up with The Oval Compass Locket: the compass design guides you, the centre star marks your destination, and the locket itself captures special moments. So the locket's about travel, but travel in a bigger sense, not just trips and holidays, but life's journey, all the stories you collect along the way, lovely little secrets to keep close to your heart.\n\u2800\nThe Oval Compass Locket comes in 18k gold or sterling silver. There's only a very limited number left of each. And they're only available until 8th July.\n\u2800\nPs, thank you so much for all your lovely words about my locket, and a massive, massive thank you to everybody who's bought one.

I've had my Naturalmat bed for a few months now. I wanted to give it some time before giving you the full report.\n\u2800\nI needed the works: bed, mattress, mattress topper, duvet and pillows. I knew I was onto a winner when I went down to the London showroom. I talked shapes and sizes, felt some fabrics, and fell asleep. This wasn't as bad as it sounds. They've got a try-before-you-buy Sleep Zone. I kicked off my shoes, lay down with a curtain drawn, and listened to lovely snoozy music. All of a sudden it was twenty minutes later...\n\u2800\nEverything's handmade down in Devon by proper craftspeople. It's all 100% natural materials, sustainably sourced, beautifully designed, and built to last (the bed even smells gorgeous). It was great dealing with people so passionate about what they do, rather than buying from a big impersonal company. The service was amazing. And by that I mean everybody was really patient with my indecisiveness \ud83d\ude01\n\u2800\nI eventually decided on the Exmouth Low Platform Bed. I went for linen upholstery in a beautiful off-white colour, despite being advised against it by, well, everybody\u2026 because the bed's main user is a big stinky labrador. But, most important, I've never slept better.

Link in bio! \ud83c\udf89\n\u2800\nThese presets have pretty much taken over my whole life in 2022. Which is why I haven't posted on here lately. It's been worth it, I think, I hope, because the thing I love most about posting on Instagram is editing pictures. I really want to share this part of the process with you lovely lot and the best way to do that is through presets.\n\u2800\nPictures really come to life by editing. Editing changes not just how your picture looks, but how it feels. And a picture conveying a feeling is a picture telling a story.\n\u2800\nI spent years learning and refining my editing skills. I put everything I know and love about editing into my first ever collection of presets, THE SLOW TRAVELER SUMMERTIME PRESETS (each pack contain five presets for Lightroom mobile/desktop).\n\u2800\nThe presets accentuate all the best things about summer: trees looking impossibly green, pretty light and pretty shadows, flowers showing off in all their colours. I made them for pictures of your lazy afternoon in the garden, your roadtrip to the countryside, your walks in the woodlands, for summer sunrises and summer sunsets, for that fairytale cottage, that rose garden in full bloom, that peaceful little village by the riverbank.\n\u2800\nThe presets make it quicker and easier to edit your pictures. But they do much more than that. They add dreaminess to your summer pictures, make your pictures woozy with summer. They fill your summer pictures with a certain romance, a special kind of nostalgia, like a memory of summer, or a dream of sumner. They capture not just how summer looks, but how it feels. They make your pictures tell better stories.\n\u2800\nHave yourself a look at my little shop (link in bio) and tell me what you think. Please feel free to share any images you post using my presets with me \u2013 I can't wait to see what you lot do with them. Okay. I'm done. I'm knackered. I'm a little bit weepy.

Each persona represents a different range of fragrances. The Uplifting Soul is described like this: \"It takes very little to excite your wild imagination. You have nature on your side, and you know just how to use it.\"\n\u2800\nOne of the fragrances in The Uplifting Soul range is The Favourite. It's floral, it's musky-sweet, it's completely georgous: a little spritz of this takes you to a dreamy English country garden. The north of England isn't looking all that dreamy just yet, so I used my imagination to bring dreaminess to the north of England.\n\u2800\nThis picture is The Grot, a favourite of mine, the window magically looking out onto the dreamiest of English country gardens: flowery, full of sweetness, georgeous enough to lift up anybody's soul.\n\u2800\nHave a go at Penhaligon\u2019s fragrance profiling quiz: penhaligons.com/uk/en/fragrance-profiling.

You see, I wasn't always as willing to walk away from a man I no longer loved. There was an earlier version of myself who would have stayed, dwelled a little longer, stunted the growth of my career in the pursuit of love (or something like it). Missed opportunities, there were many. And yet what would our twenties be without a little naivet\u00e9 to cloud our judgement and lead us astray. And astray it did, all the way to South Africa. \n\nBut before I get ahead of myself, an interlude of context is well overdue. Many of you might be wondering where we are now in the timeline. And many more of you might be wondering what would prompt a young twenty-something year old who appeared to have it all going on, to turn around and give it all up. She who owned a house, a business, a career. Appearance, it should be noted, can be misleading. But isn\u2019t that the greatest gift and equal downfall of the 21st Century?\n\nI sold everything I owned, including a bakery, and packed what was left into three overweight suitcases. Okay fine - it was four. But one of those was filled with books, mostly poetry I was really into at the time. Clich\u00e9? Probably. But if I was going to sell all my things and move to a foreign country for a guy I barely knew, you\u2019d better believe I was taking Rupi Kaur alongside me for the ride. \n\nBefore moving to South Africa, I had dabbled in Lalaland. I had traipsed across the country to Upstate New York with my best friend in tow and drowned my sorrows in numerous bottles of cheap red wine. I had rendezvoused with a documentary film director in not one but three countries, only to find out there is more to life than organic wine and air purifiers. And before this whirlwind of misadventures came the catalyst, the turning point, the defining moment that sent me into a spiral of \"try everything once, twice to be sure\".\n\nIt happened on the very continent I ran away to, but much sooner than you thought. It was 2018 when I outgrew innocence.

It was 2020, aka doomsday for a career in the travel industry. Without the ability to run away from my problems in a physical sense, I employed the stories series as a metaphorical getaway. An escape of self. A reckoning of former versions of myself once lived, once loved and now long lost in the distance of a decade. \"Who am I?\" I would ask myself mid morning skin-routine. Somewhere in between my overpriced foam cleanser and rosewater toner I would pause, as if on cue, waiting for a voice to answer.\n\nIt's my 29th birthday so expectations are low. I'm a year off being worthy of a celebration and my life is in ruins. I know that sounds dramatic but I'm a digital nomad turned homebody. An escape artist without an escape route. A citizen of a country I can no longer fly home to and most shocking of all, I'm trapped in a country that has banned the sale of alcohol. The straits are dire for a writer sans vino to drown out the self doubt pity party.\n\nI had now surpassed the naivety of my early twenties *or so it seemed* and since graduated to playing grown ups in a city I loved with a man I no longer did. That's not to say I never did, but there must come a time when everything temporary ends. And everything in life, it should be noted, is temporary. The only thing permanent in this life is change. At least those were my words to self as I packed four suitcases full of (then) 28 years of living into checked bags and boarded a one-way flight to South Africa in a haze of uncertainty, even then.\n\nIn truth, I had loose plans on arrival. I was trying on this new look of going with the flow.

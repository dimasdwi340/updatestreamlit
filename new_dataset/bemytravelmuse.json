I closed one of the biggest deals my firm ever had and watched as they congratulated my male superior who did 1% of the work instead of me, who did 99%. Shortly after, I finally made the choice to buy a one-way ticket to Bangkok and leave it all behind. I bought the domain for bemytravelmuse, quit that job, and took a leap of faith. \u2063\n\u2063\n10 years ago I didn\u2019t know what I wanted out of life and Instagram barely existed yet, blogs made very little money, and I was leaving a stable and lucrative career, but there had to be more and I realized money didn\u2019t make me happy. Freedom did. \u2063\n\u2063\nIt would be 6 months before I started posting regularly and really \u201cstarted\u201d the blog, but 10 years ago is when I pushed the purchase button on the flight and committed. \u2063\n\u2063\nThere were some very lean years. I only slept in dorms, hitchhiked to keep going, and would write freelance articles for as little as $50 to keep the dream alive. But one thing I knew for sure - I wasn\u2019t going to watch someone else get credit for what I did ever again, no matter what it took. \u2063\n\u2063\nI met my love on the road, and we\u2019re starting a family, but I\u2019ll never forget my first baby - my blog.

Now it gets nearly 500k visits every month and I\u2019m so thankful for it all. \u2063\n\u2063\nFor so much of it I felt like I was too far behind, not smart enough, never would be good enough, but somehow I stuck with it anyway.

On our grueling backpack training hikes up to Yosemite Falls and to Glacier Point (the road is closed!), we sucked on the peanut shells to replenish our lost salts, while the protein packed nuts kept us fueled for the constant uphills!  Cian loved cracking the shells, and saving them to burn on our fire at the end of the day.\n \nPeanuts are the perfect outdoor snack, whether you are at a summer baseball game or adventuring through our beautiful national parks.\n \nRemember to Leave No Trace! Even though the shells are biodegradable, it\u2019s never OK to throw them on the trails. They do make great fire starters though :)\n\nLoad up for your summer adventures with the code FUELTHEFUN15 (15% off in-shell peanuts ONLY.

Seriously..\nThese things are the must haves when camping this summer. \n\n1. @rockpalsofficial (gifted) power bank is the newest addition to my camping arsenal and I have to say it\u2019s changed how we camp and what we pack. Now we can use our rechargeable headlamps, lanterns, watches, cameras, gimbal, etc without worry. After a week of camping, charging everything, we still had 71% power left! I have the 500, but the 250 would be perfect for most families. We also have the solar panels which work so quickly to recharge.. now I just need the #vanlife  van to go with it \ud83e\udd23\n\n2. @kammok hammock stand is another newer addition and has changed my world! I\u2019ve never been one to sit and chill much while camping, but with my hammock stand I literally spent an entire day snoozing and reading while cian was off fishing. \u2764\ufe0f\n\n3. @woodscanada tent. I bought this tent for my birthday 2 years ago and it has made our camping life so much easier. Cian puts it up and down on his own in only a couple of minutes. We have used it in the rain, freezing temperatures, hot summers and in wind storms with no issues. It really is the best! \n\n4. @the.glamplife camping mat is also one of our favorite additions in the past few years. It serves as our doorstep and chill space. It washes easily and packs relatively small. It\u2019s my one \u201ccute thing\u201dthat always brightens up our site! \n\nThere are a few other things we have upgraded to recently that I also love, but that isn\u2019t pictured here. After 8 years of using my Coleman stove, I used my @rei dividend this year to get the @eurekacamping stove that has an auto ignition button and temperature control. Not a necessity, but boy did it make cooking easier this past trip! \n\nAs we prepare for our next week long camping trip, I\u2019m wondering what your favorite camp supplies are that I should know about!! \n\n#camping #campinglife #campingtrip #campinghacks #campinggear #campingvibes #coloradoexplored #colorado #visitcolorado #campingwithkids #kidswhoexplore #outdoorsfamily #familyadventures #getoutside", "comment_count": 26, "like_count": 620}, "post4": {"caption": "Sunrise of Sunset? \n\nFor us, the best part of any visit to the Grand Canyon is watching the colors pop as the sun sets each night. \n\n#grandcanyon #grandtetonnationalpark #nationalparks #nationalparkgeek #nationalparkservice #nationalparkphotography #familytravel #getoutside #hiketheworld #arizonahiking #arizona #visitarizona #arizonatourism #arizonasky #arizonaisgorgeous #arizonaadventures #grandcanyonnps #grandcanyonsouthrim #sunsetlovers", "comment_count": 37, "like_count": 633}, "post5": {"caption": "When adventure calls, I say yes! \n\nA friend put out an open invitation to join their family on a camping trip in Colorado.

And truth be told I\u2019m a total completist as well, so it wasn\u2019t that hard to convince me \ud83e\udd23\n\nWe went on an hour long river boat ride (@bricktownwatertaxi) through the canals of Bricktown at 9:30 pm.

It is definitley a fun sight to see in Oklahoma City. It\u2019s connected to an even more amazing park and outdoor space that is well worth visiting during the day. \n\nWe had seen this bridge and the park it\u2019s connected to a few times as we drove around, and since it was our last night in town, I obliged! It did not disappoint either! It changes colors every few seconds making the colors bleed into each other. We \u2764\ufe0f it! \n\nThis is just one of the many things in OKC that surprised us and thoroughly impressed us. There is so much work going into making OKC modern and exciting to visit. Beautiful open park spaces, state of the art museums, delicious dining options from small mom and pop shops to larger restaurants. \n\nWe also stopped by the @okcnm, which is fantastic at night as the chairs are lit up beautifully! \n\nThis trip definitely surprised me and changed my view of Oklahoma! (Much to my moms delight!). We can\u2019t wait to go back as we have much more to see and do! \n\n#seeokc #visitoklahoma #visitoklahomacity #oklahomacity #oklahoma #oklahomagirl #scissortailpark #skydancebridge #skydance #lightupthenight #familytravel #travelwithkids #familyadventures #outdoorsfamilies #takeyourkidseverywhere #homeschoolmom #homeschooling #worldschool #worldschooling #unschoollife", "comment_count": 21, "like_count": 651}, "post8": {"caption": "\ud83d\udcd6 Homeschoolers take note! \n\nAs a homeschool family we are always on the hunt for cool learning opportunities and our trip to @visitokc was perfect for this! Below are our top choices of places to visit in the city to learn more about the history of the state. \n\n\ud83d\udccdThe @firstamericansmuseum, newly opened this past August, is the place to go to learn more about the 39 tribes of Oklahoma, the history of how these tribes came to Oklahoma and what has happened since. There are so many family oriented activities that make this museum particularly engaging. \n\n\ud83d\udccdThe @okcnm is one of the best museums we have ever visited. Showcasing the moments before the OKC bombing, the rescue efforts and the aftermath through interactive modules and video stories makes this a highly engaging museum. While the subject matter is heavy, this museum is well worth exploring with older kids. This is also a @nationalparkservice site, so don\u2019t forget to pick up a ranger booklet to earn your badge. \n\n\ud83d\udccdThe @nationalcowboymuseum is another excellent place to put on your OKC itinerary. The museum explores the life of First Americans as well as cowboy culture showcasing beautiful art as well as plenty of hands on activities. We loved Prosperity Junction and all the outdoor exhibits for kids. \n\n\ud83d\udccdCentennial Land Run Statues are a fun stop near the Bass Pro Shop to learn about the first land grab and how land was disbursed here. \n\n\ud83d\udccdStop by the Timeline Mural in Bricktown to explore Oklahoma\u2019s history through paintings. A great stop before and after your visit to see everything you have learned! \n\nBesides learning opportunities, there are also tons of fun places to let off steam during a visit as well. From rafting to amazing playgrounds, OKC has it all.
